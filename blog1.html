            <h1>Frontend-Mentor </h1>
            <p> I really like Frontend, and Frontend-Mentor is one of the best website to imporove your Frontend skills. Frontend Mentor is a platform where developers can learn and improve their frontend developing skills alongside with other developers by doing the challenges given. Anybody can try this website its free but for few things it can cost you but free part is what we need to do the challenges. There are five difficulty levels to the challenges that they offer: <li>Newbie </li>   <li> Junior  </li> <li> Intermediate </li>  <li> Advanced</li>  <li> Guru . </li>
            A lot of these challenges are free but there are premium challenges you can get that if you pay a monthly or yearly fees. The newbie challenges is mostly of HTML and CSS challenges that will test out out css skills. These are nice and small projects, a few card components projects. Actually it sound easy, but the first few challenges that I did really tested my css skills with flexbox and grid, especially while doing HTML and CSS challenges. these challenges text your skills in all way and it really helps you improve your css in responsive layout, but it gets tougher when you move up to new level. in here you can improve your Javascript too starting from newbie challenges. </p>
